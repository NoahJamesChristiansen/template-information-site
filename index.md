# Welcome

This space serves as a reflection of my journey in political philosophy, where I explore how politics is inherently grounded in philosophical inquiry. As a speech and debate educator, I emphasize the connections between political science, philosophy, and debate, encouraging students to explore the complex intersections of these fields in Policy and Lincoln-Douglas debate.

In addition to my academic work, I am a freelance journalist and an intern reporter with the Los Angeles Blade, where I write on topics that intersect with politics, culture, and society. Through these varied projects, I aim to bridge the gap between abstract theory and real-world applications.

This site will also feature The Anti-Oedipus Project where I dissect each sentence of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus.
