# A

Accessibility
: The ability for software, such as a web page, to be usable in many different circumstances, such as with disabled users or users in extreme situations where they cannot hear, see or otherwise interact with the content normally. 

# C

Client
: In Web Development, refers to the browser side of rendering a website. The browser interprets HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render the webpage for the client.

CSS
: Standing for "Cascading Style Sheets", these documents are used to determine how a website looks, such as colors and spacing.

# F

File System
: The virtual way a computer stores its files. It organizes files in a tree-like structure and can be accessed by referencing the directories the files are in.

# H

HTML
: Standing for "Hypertext Markup Language", it is a language that structures web pages with tags.

# J

JavaScript
: A scripting language used in web browsers to modify the behavior of web applications.

# M

Markdown
: A system of marking up text files so that a static generator or other parsing tool can interpret them and render the HTML properly, without the need of the user implementing their own HTML in most cases.

# R

Repository
: A special kind of file structure within a file system that allows you to store files, collaborate with other developers and users, and manage versions of the code easily. Repositories can be either local (on your computer) or remote (on a website). Remote repositories can be hosted on sites like GitHub or GitLab where the files' contents can be viewed and release versions of the software can be downloaded.

# S

Server
: In Web Development, refers to the server side of rendering a website. While the website may be rendered as an interface that the user can interact with in a browser, the browser sends messages to a server across the internet to retrieve files, assets, generate pages and possibly even work with a database or run custom commands.

Static Generator 
: A program that transforms HTML, markdown and other scripts into a series of HTML pages. This is in contrast to something like PHP where the pages are rendered when called by the client.
